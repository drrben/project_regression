$$ Age = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Height+\epsilon $$ with P1-P4 and full rank assumption

with the rank assumption and under P1-P4 which are:
P1: Errors are centered
P2: The model is homoscedastic. Variance of all the error terms are same.
P3: Errors are uncorrelated.
P4: Errors are gaussian.
We also assume that no high leverage outliers are present.
In order to study those hypothesis, we’ll be visualing the regression line and then the residuals graphically to observe if they satisfy our assumptions. We’ll also build the following tests to further investigate the postulates 2,3 and 4:
Breush-Pagan test for P2,
Durbin-Watson test for P3,
Shapiro-Wilks test for P4
We’ll check if our full rank assumption is met.
We will also be computing the Cook distances to detect if there are outliers that change too much our estimations for beta’s.
Finally, we’ll build confidence intervals for the betas to study the efficiency of the model.

#Q2

summary(abalone)

diag(var(abalone))
sqrt(diag(var(abalone)))

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
for (i in 2:ncol(abalone)){
  boxplot(abalone[i], boxwex=0.5, cex.axis=0.75, main=colnames(abalone[i]))
}

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
for (i in 2:ncol(abalone)){
  hist(unlist(abalone[i]), main=colnames(abalone[i]))
}

```
Considering the boxplots of all the features in the dataset, all the variables present outliers (by the definition of quantiles and interquantile range). Height has two significant outliers. In addition, The medians of the various different types of weights are more or less close to each other. 

Considering the Histograms, It's easy to see how the distribution of Rings is more or less centered, the Length and the Diameter are left skewed (the frequency of larger values is bigger), while all the others present are right skewed (frequency of smaller values is bigger).

```{r}
#Q3

plot(Rings ~ Length + Diameter + Height + Whole_wt + Shuck_wt + Visc_wt + Shell_wt, data=abalone_train)

```
We can graphically see the positive correlation between Rings (and consequently, age of Abalone) and Height, confirming the biologists’ hypothesis. In general, from the scatter plots, we can also see that there are linear correlations between Rings and other variables such as Length and Shell Weight. 

```{r}
#Q4

linear_mod = lm(Rings ~ Height, data=abalone_train)
summary(linear_mod)

```

```{r}
#Q5
ggplot(abalone_train, aes(x=Height, y=Rings)) + geom_point(shape=1) + geom_smooth(method=lm)

```
From the graph can be seen that are present two outliers of the predictor Height. Those two points are high leverage and are affecting the fit of the line. The line doesn't seem to be the best fit. Taking a polynomial or exponential function of Height might provide a better fit.

```{r}
#Q6

plot(linear_mod)
durbinWatsonTest(linear_mod, max.lag=10)
acf(resid(linear_mod))
bptest(linear_mod)
shapiro.test(resid(linear_mod))

```
The errors are not centered since the Residuals-Fitted graph does not have a line which on average is zero due to the presence of two outliers in the data.
The errors are Gaussian  in the lower quantiles since in the Normal Q-Q plot more or less lies on the line that represent the quantiles of the standard normal. The plot diverges at higher quantiles, suggesting that we could perform feature engineering. The results of the Shapiro-Wilkes test also do not suggest Gaussian distribution of residuals.
Possibly due to the presence of outliers, there is heteroskedasticity since the line in the Scale-Location plot is really far from being horizontal. In addition, the studentized Breusch-Pagan test has a very low p-value, so there is high probability of heteroskedasticity. 
The results of Durbin-Watson test suggest autocorrelation. This may be due to ordering in the data. 

```{r}
#we remove the two outliers and sort the data randomly
new_abalone_train = abalone_train[-c(961, 1425),]

set.seed(1234)
new_abalone_train = new_abalone_train[sample(nrow(new_abalone_train)), ]

linear_mod_new = lm(Rings ~ Height, data=new_abalone_train)
summary(linear_mod_new)
plot(linear_mod_new)

durbinWatsonTest(linear_mod_new, max.lag=10)
acf(resid(linear_mod_new))
bptest(linear_mod_new)
shapiro.test(resid(linear_mod_new))

ggplot(new_abalone_train, aes(x=Height, y=Rings)) + geom_point(shape=1) + geom_smooth(method=lm)

```
We removed the outliers sequentially till none of the points have Cook's distance greater than 1 
From the new graph we can see that the elimination of the outliers allow us to better satisfy the postulates. The errors are more centered since the red line in the residuals vs fitted plot is on average more close to 0. 
However, we still see some trend in the variance of the residuals. Furthermore, the results of the B-P test also suggest that there exists heteroskedasticity.
The results of the Q-Q plot and the S-W test suggest that the residuals do not follow a Gaussian Distribution.
Sorting the data seems to have removed the apparent autocorrelation in the residual terms as seen from the results of the D-W test.

```{r}
#here we used the logarithm of the number of Rings to get a better fit
new_abalone_train$log_rings = log(new_abalone_train$Rings)

linear_mod_log_simple = lm(log_rings ~ Height, data=new_abalone_train)
summary(linear_mod_log_simple)
plot(linear_mod_log_simple)
durbinWatsonTest(linear_mod_log_simple, max.lag=10)
acf(resid(linear_mod_log_simple))
bptest(linear_mod_log_simple)
shapiro.test(resid(linear_mod_log_simple))

ggplot(new_abalone_train, aes(x=Height, y=log_rings)) + geom_point(shape=1) +geom_smooth(method=lm)

```
We decided to use the logarithm of the Rings as the response variable. This appears to better satisfy the postulate of homoskedasticity as seen from the results of the results of the B-P test. It also seems to better satisfy the condition of Gaussian distribution of residuals as we get a better value of the S-W statistic. Lastly, we observe a better fit as seen from the graph.

```{r}
#Q7
confint(linear_mod_log_simple, level=0.95)

```
In the context of the problem, these confidence intervals (of the coefficients) means that an additional unit change in Height will change the response variable (number of rings or its logarithm) by a value present in the confidence interval 95% of the times (so with 95% confidence).

```{r}
#Q8
```
As the p-value is much less that an hypothetical 0.05 alpha, we reject the null hypothesis that $\beta_1 = 0$. Hence, there is a statistically significant relationship between the Height and the number of rings.

corrplot(cor(withoutSex), method = "ellipse")

```
We decided to keep as dependent variable the logarithm of the number of rings, since we saw that the postulate are more close to being met with this manipulation. First of all, we started fitting a model with all the variables to check those that we need to keep and those that we need to delete. However, we will first remove the point which has a Cook distance greater than 1 (which is the same outlier that we also removed before) and, in addition, we remove also another observation which has a Cook distance between 0.5 an 1. Even if this observation can be left in the model we decided to remove it since it has a big impact on the verification of the postulates. In addition, we need to remove it to have a dataset of a dimension that is the same of the one on which we performed the simple linear model.This last manipulation is necessary in order to perform the Anova and Ancova.

In addition to the Height, the features we have chosen to use in our first model are: Diameter and Whole_wt. As Diameter is highly correlated with Length ( but have a better correlation with log_rings) and Whole_wt is highly correlated with the other three weight features.

```{r}
new_abalone_scale = data.frame(rapply(new_abalone_train, scale, c("numeric","integer"), how="replace"))
head(new_abalone_scale)

```

```{r}
linear_mod_log = lm(log_rings ~ Height + Whole_wt + Diameter, data=new_abalone_scale)
summary(linear_mod_log)
plot(linear_mod_log)
durbinWatsonTest(linear_mod_log, max.lag=10)
acf(resid(linear_mod_log))
bptest(linear_mod_log)
shapiro.test(resid(linear_mod_log))

```
This models meets the validity postulates. However, we try another model where we replace Whole_wt by Shuck_wt , Visc_wt, and Shell_wt to see if this model better explains the number of rings and to see if one of these features has more impact than the other ones.

```{r}
linear_mod_log = lm(log_rings ~ Height + Shuck_wt + Visc_wt + Shell_wt + Diameter, data=new_abalone_scale)
summary(linear_mod_log)
plot(linear_mod_log)
durbinWatsonTest(linear_mod_log, max.lag=10)
acf(resid(linear_mod_log))
bptest(linear_mod_log)
shapiro.test(resid(linear_mod_log))

```
This models meets the validity postulates. We can reject the null hypothesis for Visc_wt as its p_value= 0.0731 > 0.05, so we make a new model without it.

```{r}
linear_mod_log = lm(log_rings ~ Height + Shuck_wt + Shell_wt + Diameter, data=new_abalone_scale)
summary(linear_mod_log)
plot(linear_mod_log)
durbinWatsonTest(linear_mod_log, max.lag=10)
acf(resid(linear_mod_log))
bptest(linear_mod_log)
shapiro.test(resid(linear_mod_log))

```

This models meets the validity postulates. The Adjusted R-squared of this model is 0.5748 > 0.4901 (Adjusted R-squared of the first model). 

After many tests we decided to implement a model with polynomial features

```{r}
linear_mod_log = lm(log_rings ~ poly(Diameter, 3) + Height + poly(Shuck_wt, 3) + poly(Shell_wt, 3), data=new_abalone_scale)
summary(linear_mod_log)
plot(linear_mod_log)
durbinWatsonTest(linear_mod_log, max.lag=10)
acf(resid(linear_mod_log))
bptest(linear_mod_log)
shapiro.test(resid(linear_mod_log))

```
```{r}
#Q10
```
To check which variables have a significant impact on the target variable (number of rings), we look at the p-values of the t-tests. If the p-value of the single variable is low it means that at a specific significance level the variable has a significant impact on the number of rings. In our final model, we observe that all the covariates are significant at a significance level of 0.05.

Through the use of polynomial features we slightly improved all the postulates. The errors are centered, normal, and less correlated than before and the model is homokedastic.

```{r}
#Q11
linear_mod_log_simple = lm(log_rings ~ Height, data=new_abalone_scale)
anova(linear_mod_log_simple, linear_mod_log)

```
we can see that it has a really small p-value and so the removal of the other other covariates results in a worse model. We are testing that all the variables, apart from Height, are not correlated with log_rings. Since the p-value is very low we reject this hypothesis, and conclude that increasing the number of covariates improved our model. 

We can also prove that our last model is better computing the mean of the squared residuals. 

```{r}
mean(linear_mod_log$residuals^2)
```
```{r}
mean(linear_mod_log_simple$residuals^2)
```

```{r}
#Q12 
ggplot(new_abalone_scale, aes(x=Sex, y=Rings)) + geom_boxplot()

new_abalone_scale['Infant'] = ifelse(new_abalone_scale$Sex == 'I','I','NI')
new_abalone_scale$Infant = as.factor(new_abalone_scale$Infant)

linear_mod_log_sex = lm(log_rings ~ poly(Diameter, 3) + Height + poly(Shuck_wt, 3) + poly(Shell_wt, 3) + Infant, data=new_abalone_scale)

anova(linear_mod_log_sex)
```
The null hypothesis is that the variance are the same for the two groups (Infants and no infants). 
Therefore, as the p-value is very small we reject the null hypothesis indicating that the variance in the two groups is different. And so an hypothetical regression line between the two groups (infant and non infants) is very similar, meaning that there is no interaction between infant and the other covariates.
